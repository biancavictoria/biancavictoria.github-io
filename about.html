                  I work part time as a Student Professional Worker at the City of Los Angeles. There, I work as desktop support for the Information Technology Agency department. 
                  I work with clients on the phone or in person to resolve their technical issues, as well as utilizing Microsoft WDS to reimage and prep PCs for deployment. I have 
                  a familiarity with Microsoft Active Directory, which I use to create user accounts and manage computers, our ticketing system, Service Now, and our remote client, 
                  BeyondTrust. To keep track of our hardware asset inventory, I use asset tags and serial numbers to trace the history of an asset, as well as reach out to users to 
                  accurately document their location and status.

              <p class = "SectionTitle work">
                Over the summer, I interned at the City of Los Angeles as a Documentum intern. I created the documentation for the CLM Application Process and a Documentum
                Production Playbook using the screen capture software, SnagIt. For the documentation, I took screen captures of the processes to login or access a variety of applications 
                and wrote specific instructions for each step. In the screen capatures, I used SnagIt to add visual elements related to a step. To ensure the documentation was 
                user-friendly, I would go through the steps myself and sign in to the applications by following the document. Other than SnagIt, I primarily used Google Sheets and Google Docs.
