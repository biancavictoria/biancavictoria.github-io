        <p class = "sectionText">I am a producer, 2D artist, and UI designer with 3 years of collegiate game development experience.
          I'm a 4th year Computer Game Science major at University of California Irvine with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction.
        </p>

        <p class = "sectionText">
          I project managed 3 student game projects, Continuum, Tournament of Magirus, and Fool's Gold. 
          I am very familiar with agile development, and organize tasks with Jira, Trello, and Google Sheets. With my positive go-getter personality, 
          I always take the initiative to reach out to check on my team and handle any sudden challenges that arise in our project. 
          My favorite producer thing to do is send fun discord messages of our recent accomplishments to show how much we appreciate our teams' work!

        </p>

        <p class = "sectionText">
          As a webtoon fanatic, I fell in love with how the art reflects the story. I took this passion and dove into all game dev art I could experiment.
          Concepting, illustrating, animating, you name it! I've meshed my love for production and art by taking on the VGDC art manager role and 
          creating/managing VGDC's new graphic design team.
        </p>
            
        

        <p class = "sectionText">
          Games I <em>LOVE</em> to play include Team Fight Tactics, Minecraft, League of Legends, Danganronpa, Pokemon Shining Pearl, Mystic Messenger, and some Roblox games.
          I'm a pretty avid farmer -- hence Minecraft, Stardew, and League.
          My gamer accomplishments would be that I'm a fast Tetris player and I don't get tilted playing League.
        </p>

        <p class = "sectionText">I also enjoy cosplaying, <em>Attack on Titan</em>, and watching reality TV.
        </p>

                Over the summer, I interned at the City of Los Angeles as a Documentum intern. I created the documentation for the CLM Application Process and a Documentum
                Production Playbook using the screen capture software, SnagIt. For the documentation, I took screen captures of the processes to login or access a variety of applications 
                and wrote specific instructions for each step. In the screen capatures, I used SnagIt to add visual elements related to a step. To ensure the documentation was 
                user-friendly, I would go through the steps myself and sign in to the applications by following the document. Other than SnagIt, I primarily used Google Sheets and Google Docs.
